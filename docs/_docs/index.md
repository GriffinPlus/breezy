## Motivation and Vision

In today's world, the use of cloud services is more than commonplace. In good faith in the integrity and security of major cloud
storage providers, many people entrust private data (be it images, videos or confidential documents) to large server
farms. But this data is then often stored unencrypted. Whether and how a provider uses this data is unclear in many cases. Even
if the provider has no unfair intentions, there may still be hackers who can gain access to the data. In both cases,
privacy is compromised and stored data is no longer secure. Only client-side encryption solves the problem.

This is where *Griffin+ Breezy* comes in by encrypting data before it is uploaded to the cloud, making it unreadable to outsiders.
*Breezy* not only encrypts the file itself, but also makes their filenames unrecognisable, so that it becomes impossible
to deduce contents from names. Encryption is transparent to a *Breezy* client.

Although encryption is a main pillar of *Breezy*, it can do much more. *Breezy* unifies the interface to various cloud storage
services making it easier for developers and administrators to integrate an application into existing infrastructure.
